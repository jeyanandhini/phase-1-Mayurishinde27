## What is Recursion? 

- The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 

- Recursion can be defined as the technique of replicating or doing again an activity in a self-similar way calling itself again and again,
  and the process continues till specific condition reaches.

-  In other words A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function.`

## What is base condition in recursion? 

- In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. 

```
 main()
{
    // Base Condition
    
    
   //  Recursive Function    
}
```

` NOTE: First write the code for Recursive Function then write for Base Condition.`
