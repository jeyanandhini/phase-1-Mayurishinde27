------------------------------------------------------------------------
In todays Algomagnet demo meet i played the role of  Ah-Counter. It was a great session, we got to know so many things. 
why it is important to be a good communicator, if some table topic is given to you then speak anything but dont waste that opportunity.

- The role of Ah-Counter was:

to note any overused words or sounds by person who speaks during the meeting,For example,ah,um,arr.

Itâ€™s important to deliver the Ah-Counter report in a positive, supportive wayâ€”just like any other evaluation.
