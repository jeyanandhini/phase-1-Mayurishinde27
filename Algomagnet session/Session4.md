What I’ve learned 📚
- Must practice Competitive Programming.
- Doing [opensource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) will differenciate us from others as most of people dont have idea what open source is.
- We should start as early as possible like from jan or feb
- For first 1 month just have a grasp on open source and should look at code base.
- then from 2nd month start contributing in open source and try to improve your documentation skill.
- 3rd month try to do some active project, and research about them and know how i can be the part of it.
- Start solving problems, and start contributing to open or any project.
- Doing all these things leads to good understanding and have good experiance 

## Start the preperation soon and fight for it 🎯
